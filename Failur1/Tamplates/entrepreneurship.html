						<p class="mb-4">Starting and running your own business requires management and entrapreneurship skills.  When you develo a product, for instance a new Cultural-tourism route of a local township, you are developing something new and are acting as an Entrepreneur.   However, when you start taking visitors on the route you begin to be more of a manager than an Entrepreneur because you are then co-ordinating and controlling business operations.</p>
						<p class="mb-4">An <strong>Entrepreneur</strong> is a person who creates a new business in the face of risk and uncertainty for the purpose of achieving profit and growth by identifying opportunities and assembling the necessary resources to capitalise on those opportunities.</p>

Intrapreneurship involves finding an opportunity within and making a profit for the business from this opportunity.     Intrapreneur differ from Entrepreneur because they prefer the security of working for an existing business and getting a regular salary rather than having all the risk fo running their own business.</p>

								<ol type="a">
									<li class="b-1">Confidence</li>
									<p>Entrepreneur are likely to be optimistic people, and usually have good reason to be optimistic.   They look at life with a positive attitute, and when they have problems or failures, they do not blame others, but analyse the situation to find the cause of the problem or failure.   Instead of blaming theselves, they take action to correct the situation so that their business can survive and grow.</p>
									<li class="b-1">Moderate risk</li>
									<p>Entrepreneurs do not take foolish risks.   They examine a business opportunity intelligently and weigh up the risk involved before reaching a decision.    If after thinking through a situation, they believe the opportunity is reasonable and can be achieved, they do market reasearch and plan towards their business goal.</p>
									<li class="b-1">Responsible</li>
									<p>Entrepreneurs prefer to be in control of their own resources and use them to achive the business objectives that they decide on.   They get job satisfaction by using these resources to help them to achieve their business plans.</p>
									<li class="b-1">Energy</li>
									<p>Entrepreneurs have more energy than the avarage person does.    As long hours and hard work are usually needed when starting a business, having lo of energy is important to achive business success.</p>
									<li class="b-1">Identify opportunities</li>
									<p>Entrepreneurs are good at finding business opportunities.   They are not so concerned about on what can be done tomorrow.</p>
									<li class="b-1">Organising</li>
									<p>Entrepreneurs know how to put the right people together to do a task.   Effetivrly combining people and jobs allows them to achieve their business ideas and objectives.</p>
									<li class="b-1">Achievement</li>
									<p>People think that entrepreneurs start their own business just to make money.   This is not true; their main reason for starting  a business is to develop a feeling of achievement and success.   Making money is just a result of that success.</p>
									<li class="b-1">Immediate feedback</li>
									<p>'Let me knw <strong>now</strong> how I am doing' is the way the entrepreneur thinks.  They want to know if they are succeeding or failing and looking for signs to show if they are achieving their business objectives.</p>

					<h1 class="mt-2 mb-4">Why entrepreneurs fail</h1>
					<ol type="a">
						<li class="b-1">Lack of management skills</li>
						<p>The main reasons for failure in most of small businesses are management inexperience or poor decision-making ability.   In these cases, the manager does not have the leadership ability and knowledge necessary to make the business work.</p>
						<li class="b-1">Lack of experience</li>
						<p>Entrepreneurs need to have experience in the type of business they want to run.   For example, if you want to start a retail clothing business, you should first work in retail clothing store to get some experience of how the business operates.</p>
						<li class="b-1">Poor control</li>
						<p>Good management is important to achieve success.  Effective managers know that any successful business needs proper management control.</p>
						<ul class="ul">
							<li class="b-1">Shortage of capital</li>
							<p>Many business owners make the mistake of starting their business with too little money.   Entrepeneurs are often very positive and optimistic people who believe that their business will be successful.   The result is that they often make mistakes about what is needed to make the business successful.</p>
							<li class="b-1">Customer credit</li>
							<p>There is lot of pressure  on a small business to sell on credit rather than cash on delivery.   You may feel that you can outdo your competitors if you sell on credit, or you may feel you need to sell on credit because your competition does so.   Whatever the case the small business owner must control credit sales very carefully.</p>
							<li class="b-1">Over investing in fixed assets</li>
							<p>Entrepreneurs may invest a lot of money in resources like land, buildings, equipment and other fixed assets.  This money normally comes from capital needed to run the business.  If you over invest in fixed assets when you really need to develop or expand, there is no money available to do so.</p>
							<li class="b-1">Poor planning</li>
							<p>Many entrepreneurs do not realise how important it is to do proper planning.  It can have a very harmful effct on their business if they do not plan their company's future right from the start.   Creating a strategic plan of action helps the entrepreneur find the best way to complete in business.</p>
							<li class="b-1">Stock shortages</li>
							<p>Customers becomes unhappy when a business does not have enough stock to sell.   When this is so, customers can became dissatisfied and not come back to your business.</p>
							<li class="b-1">Attitudes</li>
							<p>Entrepreneurs must be prepered to work hard and to give up many things to make their business succeed.  If you thing small business management is easy, you should not start your business.   Success requires hard work and lot's of it!</p>
							<li class="b-1">Ethics</li>
							<p>Managers must practise ethical behaviour.   This means they must be honest in the way they run their business.   entrepreneurs who cheat or are dishonest may score for a short period, but over time they usually lose.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">Accounting is the recording of transactions in terms of money and the interpretation of results.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Normally this is done for a business, but every individual can also record their own transactions.</p>
                    <h1 class="mt-2 mb-4">The aim of accounting</h1>
                    <p class="mb-4">In Accounting we learn how to record money values of transactions in the books of a business so that the owner have a permanent record of them.   From these records we can determine whether the business has made a profit or suffered a loss, and what the financial position of the business is.   The aim of Accounting is therefore to keep a record of everything that has happens in business.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">Assets can be described as the possessions owned by a business such as money, buildings, vehicles, furniture, equipment, etc.   In Accounting we distinguish between two types of assets:</p>

                            <p>Fixed assets are bought for the purpose of being use4d and not with a view to resell them.   These assets, therefore, have a relatively long life.   A fixed asse may, however, be sold again shold it no longer be fit for the purpose for which it was purchased:</p>
                            <ol type="1">
                                <li>Land and buldings</li>

                            <p>Finacial assets include fixed deposits that are invested for longer than 12 months.   Should a fixed deposit mature withing 12 months, it is not classified as a non-current asset, but as a current asset.</p>

                        <li class="b-1">Current assets</li>
                        <p>Current assets consists of cash or assets that will be converted into cash withing a relatively short perion, usually 12 months.   It also includes amonts owed by debtors these are also possessions of the business, but in a more abstract form:</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">This is the interest a person(owner) has in the business.   The owner's equity can, also be seen as the amount which the business owes the owner.   When the owner starts a business the owner's equity equals the amount that the owner invests in the business that was used to buy assets and pay expenses.   Later when a profit is made, the profit will increase the owner's equity, because the business also owes the profit to the owner.</p>

Examples of such are: water and electricity, wage and salaries, telephone expenses, licenses, insurance, etc.   Expenses are something that has to be paid, but for which in return bo assets can be shown.   These expenses leave the owner poorer and therefore the owner's equity decreases.</p>

In the event of stock sold, the stock is sold for more than it was paid for.   An operating income enriches the owner and therefore increases the owner's equity.</p>

This accounting rule reflects the princible of double entry and is the basic principle that has to be strictly adhered to for each transaction made.   If this rules is applied throughout, the total of all the debit entries will be equal to the total of the credit entries.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Naturally they have to be the same all the time.   This is done by drawing up a trial balance.   A trial balance can be described as a list of all final debit and credit balances and the totals of other accounts in the ledger.</p>

                        <p>The cash receipts journal, as the name indicates, is a Subsidiary journal in which all the cash receipts are entered.   This includes cash, cheques, postal orders, credit cart slips, etc.  The cash receipts journal has to agree with the depit side of the bank account.</p>

                        <p>Some businesses do not use a cash receipts journal or a cash payments jounal.  They use an analysis cash book for all cash transactions.   The analysis cash book therefore replace the cash receipts and cash payments journals.   The analysis cash book also cobtains the bank account.   When the analysis cash book is used, no bank account is opened in the ledger.   The bank column opened in the analysis cash book replaces the bank accont in the ledger.</p>
                        <p>The analysis cash book is debited with all the money received and credited with all the payments.   The analysis cash book is a Subsidiary journal as well as a ledger account and therefore has to balanced every month to calculate the bank balance.</p>

                            <p class="mb-4">Accounting is the recording of transactions in terms of money and the interpretation of results.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4">Normally this is done for a business, but every individual can also record their own transactions.</p>
                            <h1 class="mt-2 mb-4">The aim of accounting</h1>
                            <p class="mb-4">In Accounting we learn how to record money values of transactions in the books of a business so that the owner have a permanent record of them.   From these records we can determine whether the business has made a profit or suffered a loss, and what the financial position of the business is.   The aim of Accounting is therefore to keep a record of everything that has happens in business.</p>

Examples of such are: water and electricity, wage and salaries, telephone expenses, licenses, insurance, etc.   Expenses are something that has to be paid, but for which in return bo assets can be shown.   These expenses leave the owner poorer and therefore the owner's equity decreases.</p>
